# Descriptive Analytics of COVID-19 Based on Socioeconomic and Demographic Factors
In this project, I try to find the relationship of socioeconomic and demographic factors of an area to the number of positive cases of COVID-19. The descriptive analytics will be carried out in three stages:
1. We will do an exploratory data analysis to get a brief information about the data that we will use
2. We will do a cluster analysis. Cluster analysis aims to grouping area based on it's socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. So that, some areas with similar characteristics will be groupped to same cluster.
3. We will do a regression analysis, this regression analysis aim to to determine the attributes that most influence the positive cases of COVID-19.

<br> East Java Province is choosen as area for this study. </br>
<br>There are 12 socioeconomic and demographics variable that will be used in this study. The data is collected from "Provinsi Jawa Timur dalam Angka 2021", an annual book from "Badan Pusat Statistik" (Central Bureau of Statistics) of East Java.</br>
<br>The daily positive cases of COVID-19 is collected from https://infocovid19.jatimprov.go.id/ on June 30 2021.
